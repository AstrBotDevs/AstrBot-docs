## 1. Create a Telegram Bot

First, open Telegram and search for `BotFather`. Click `Start`, then send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to enter your bot's name and username.

After successful creation, `BotFather` will provide you with a `token`. Please keep it secure.

If you need to use the bot in group chats, you must disable the bot's [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode). Send the `/setprivacy` command to `BotFather`, select your bot, and then choose `Disable`.

## 2. Configure AstrBot

1. Enter the AstrBot admin panel
2. Click `Bots` in the left sidebar
3. In the interface on the right, click `+ Create Bot`
4. Select `telegram`

Fill in the configuration fields that appear:

- ID: Enter any value to distinguish between different messaging platform instances.
- Enable: Check this option.
- Bot Token: Your Telegram bot's `token`.

Please ensure your network environment can access Telegram. You may need to configure a proxy using `Configuration -> Other Settings -> HTTP Proxy`.
